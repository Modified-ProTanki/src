# Requirements
+ Needs [ProTanki](https://playprotanki.com) installed
+ Brain and Knowledge :)
# Installation
Anyways, no YouTube anymore as it gets more confusion and unfunnier. <b>But how to install?</b>
# Windows
- Choose one (just only one like a bite)
- Download `application.xml`
- Press WIN + R, type `C:\Program Files (x86)\ProTanki Online\META-INF\AIR` (to make sure if you're lazy)
- Replace it with modified one
- Profit and play
# Mac OS X
There are no methods of platform like Mac OS, it's unsupported.
# Linux (knowningly as Debian, Fedora, Linux Mint, etc.)
**"The Most Hardest Method"**: Now formerly you can have as Preloader (without Prelauncher to be lazy) with Adobe AIR on Linux.<br>
Unfortunately I don't know any further information on how to install it on Linux, as you cannot download assets from Windows directory.
