<b>EDIT AS OF 18 SEPTEMBER 2023:</b> This project is as known <i>discontinued at indefinite amount of time</i>. Though I got IP-banned for using third-party service, still doesn't have access even with VPN on my computer; I will probably change my new IP (or resetting a router, then paying for it, I guess that would work in my computer traffic) soon.<br>
Again, I ain't even knowing when I open due to our laziness, even I don't hire them no more.<br>
If you want to look at <a href="https://github.com/bjuonday/Modified-ProTanki/blob/main/old.README.md">old README.md</a>, then I kept it for archival purposes. Installation methods are pretty much outdated, you know.
