# Installation
Anyways, no YouTube anymore as it gets more confusion and unfunnier. <b>But how to install?</b>
1. Choose one (just only one like a bite)
2. Download `application.xml`
3. Press WIN + R, type `C:\Program Files (x86)\ProTanki Online\META-INF\AIR` (to make sure if you're lazy)
4. Replace it with modified one
5. Profit and play

# What does it change?
