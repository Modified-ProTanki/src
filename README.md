  <i align="center">Especially gotten from <a title="This repository was deleted." href="https://github.com/Kleins0/protanki-mod">this repository</a> and remodified it.</i>
</p><br>

## This project will be unmaintained in uncertain time.
Constant library changes can be a big problem for me. Due to them constantly changing script file/folder names in library.swf file (could be preventing to get onto the modified client), this slows my progress of getting it done, especially my skills in knowledge of this kind of programming language (ActionScript).<br>
**Possibly,** you could download these original ones and straight-up replace with textures and scripts; but with patience, you don't have to, you just do it **your own self.**

<h1>Requirements</h1>

- Knowledge
- Needs <a href="https://playprotanki.com">ProTanki</a> installed

<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2>Windows (depends on Adobe AIR's compatibility)</h2>

- Choose one (just only one like a bite)
- Download <code>application.xml</code>
- Press WIN + R, type <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\ProTanki Online\META-INF\AIR</code> (to make sure if you're lazy)
- Replace it with modified one
- Profit and play<br>

<h2>Mac OS X</h2>

There are no methods of platforms like Mac OS, it's unsupported.

<h2>Linux (knowningly as Debian-based distros, etc.)</h2>

**"The Most Hardest Method"**: Now formerly you can have as Preloader (just for quick access to play ProTanki) with Adobe Flash Player on Linux.<br>
_**...but if you play it with that file, you'll get IP-banned for "using modified client". So, buckle up with your VPN, guys and gals!**_<br>
Unfortunately I don't know any further information on how to install it nor using Wine on Linux, as it cannot download assets from Windows directory.
