# Installation
Anyways, no YouTube anymore as it gets more confusion and unfunnier. <b>But how to install?</b>
- If you haven't installed ProTanki, [then go try it from link.](https://playprotanki.com)
- Choose one (just only one like a bite)
- Download `application.xml`
- Press WIN + R, type `C:\Program Files (x86)\ProTanki Online\META-INF\AIR` (to make sure if you're lazy)
- Replace it with modified one
- Profit and play
